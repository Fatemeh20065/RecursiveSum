# Recursive Sum to One (C# Console Application)

## 📖 About
This project is a simple **C# console application** that demonstrates how recursion can be used to solve mathematical problems.  
The program asks the user to enter a positive integer, then calculates the sum of all numbers from that integer down to 1 using a **recursive method**.  
It is designed as a beginner-friendly project for students and developers who want to understand recursion in practice.

## ✨ Features
- 📥 **User Input**: Prompts the user to enter a positive integer.
- 🔄 **Recursive Function**: Implements a method `SumToOne(int n)` that calls itself until the base case is reached.
- ⚠️ **Error Handling**: Displays an error message if the user enters zero or a negative number.
- 📤 **Output**: Shows the sum of numbers from `n` down to `1` in a clear format.
